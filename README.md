## What it does

Phylax makes your self-hosted Frigate NVR feel like a proper mobile app.

- **Auto-switches between home and remote URLs** based on your Wi-Fi. No VPN, no manual toggles.
- **Reliable push-style notifications** with snapshot thumbnails. Tap a notification and you land right on the event.
- **Live system health at a glance.** CPU and GPU load in the top bar, tap for per-camera FPS and detector inference.
- **Fine-grained notification filters** by camera, zone and severity. One notification per event, never a spam flood.
- **Motion alerts per camera.** Movement with no recognised object, with its own sound and an optional urgent mode.
- **Picture-in-Picture.** Pop a camera out into a floating window and keep watching while you use other apps.
- **Mute cameras or groups on the fly.** Tap the bell in the toolbar to silence noisy cameras or whole zones without diving into Settings.
- **Secure by default.** Supports client certificates (mTLS) for Cloudflare Access / nginx setups, self-signed certs on LAN.
- **Two-way talk** on doorbell and intercom cameras, with the phone's call-quality audio path engaged for clearer voice.
- **Guided first-run setup.** Add your Frigate server in a couple of taps; runtime permissions are requested only when a feature needs them.
- **Fullscreen and landscape viewing.** Open a camera edge-to-edge (notch-aware), with more of the screen given to video in landscape.

## What's new

<!-- Updated from WHATSNEW.md in the release preparation commit, alongside the version bump. -->

Version 2.13:

* Turning on notifications now asks for the permissions it needs one at a time, instead of stacking dialogs on top of each other
* Alert notifications come back on their own after the app updates, not only after a reboot
* The background health check that restarts a dropped listener can no longer be refused by Android
* Frigate served under a base path, for example /frigate, now loads
* The reliability settings show whether alarms and reminders are granted, and the Do Not Disturb row opens the system list on Phylax
* Shared debug logs record only the session cookie's attributes, never its value

Every release is listed on the [Releases page](https://github.com/sfortis/phylax/releases).

## Install

Install from **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.asksakis.freegate/)** for automatic updates through the F-Droid client. Or tap the **Get it on Obtainium** badge at the top with [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) installed for one-tap subscribe and auto-update straight from GitHub releases. You can also grab the latest signed APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/sfortis/phylax/releases/latest). All channels ship the same reproducible, self-signed build.

First-run setup:
1. Open **Settings → Connection** and enter your internal URL (e.g. `https://frigate.home.lan`) and external URL (e.g. `https://frigate.example.com`).
2. Under **Network mode** leave on **Auto** and add your home Wi-Fi SSIDs.
3. If your Frigate requires auth, enter username + password under **Frigate Account**.
4. If you use mTLS behind Cloudflare Access / nginx, import your `.p12` certificate under **Client certificate (mTLS)**.
5. Enable **Notifications** and grant **Ignore battery optimizations** when prompted.

## Verifying a download

Every APK is signed with the same key, whether it came from F-Droid, Obtainium or the
Releases page. To check a file before you install it:

```
apksigner verify --print-certs phylax-v2.12.apk
```

The certificate fingerprint must be:

```
SHA-256  3B:F1:A6:F7:4A:92:28:AA:0F:59:0E:84:54:3A:5A:8F:C9:C8:C9:C3:0C:49:8C:A1:F3:3B:E3:5A:DA:9E:BB:A6
```

A different fingerprint means the file was not built by this project.

## Accessing Frigate as a Home Assistant add-on

The Home Assistant Frigate add-on ships with the authenticated web UI on port **8971**, but that port is **not exposed by default**. Phylax needs a reachable URL, so you have to publish it once:

1. In Home Assistant, open the Frigate add-on **Configuration** tab and map port `8971` to the host.
2. Restart the add-on and confirm the UI loads at `https://<your-ha-ip>:8971`. Your browser will warn about the self-signed certificate; that warning is expected and safe to accept on your local network.
3. Use that same URL as your **Internal URL** in Phylax under Settings → Connection.

Frigate generates a random `admin` password on first install and prints it once to the add-on logs. Either grab that password from the logs, or create a dedicated Frigate user from the Frigate UI, then enter the credentials in Phylax under **Frigate Account**.

## How URL switching works

| Connection mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Auto** | SSID in your home list: Internal URL. Anything else (cellular, guest Wi-Fi, airport): External URL. |
| **Internal** | Always Internal, regardless of network. |
| **External** | Always External. Useful for debugging remote access from home. |

The **INT / EXT** badge shows the active URL mode (orange text for internal, red for external on a neutral dark capsule). Next to it, a **cellular-style signal badge** reports reachability: 4 bars (green at or below 50 ms), 3 bars (green at or below 150 ms), 2 bars (amber at or below 300 ms), 1 bar (red above 300 ms), or **ERROR** if validation fails. Latency is re-probed every 5 seconds while Home is foreground; a 24-sample rolling history feeds the status popup graph.

## Notifications

The background `FrigateAlertService` keeps a `wss://.../ws` connection open and subscribes to the `reviews` channel — Frigate's curated, server-filtered notification feed (false positives, sub-threshold scores and per-camera notify rules are applied before a review is emitted).

- **Alert** (severity `alert`) and **Detection** (severity `detection`): tap opens `/review?id=<review_id>`.
- **Dedupe per review id.** The `new → update → end` lifecycle collapses to exactly one notification.
- **Zone filter.** Reviews without matching zones are dropped for cameras where you've allow-listed zones.
- **Reliable wake-up.** Alerts ring through Do Not Disturb at alarm volume even on Samsung One UI's vibrate ringer mode, routed via `STREAM_ALARM`. Music ducks (lowers volume briefly) instead of pausing.
- **Custom bundled tones** (CC0) registered with MediaStore as **Phylax Alert** / **Phylax Chime** so they show up by name in the system sound picker — switchable from Settings → Notifications → Sounds.
- **Only on external URL.** Turn notifications off automatically while you are on your home Wi-Fi.

### Motion notifications

Frigate publishes raw pixel motion per camera on the same socket, which fires even when no object is recognised. Opt in per camera under **Settings → Notifications → Motion (no object)**.

- **Per-camera cooldown**, one minute by default.
- **Its own sound**, picked separately from alerts and detections.
- **Urgent mode** for a pop-up banner and stronger vibration.
- **Tap opens the recording** at the moment the motion started.
- Requires `detect` to be enabled for that camera in your Frigate config.

### Android 14+ reliability

| Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE` | Sidesteps the 6-hour cap imposed on `DATA_SYNC` foreground services |
| Bounded wake lock | Held only while an incoming alert is handled, so it is posted before the CPU suspends |
| Network callback kick | Forces a reconnect on network regain instead of waiting for exponential backoff |
| 5-min revive alarm | Restarts the service and reconnects the socket if it is no longer live |
| 15-min WorkManager watchdog | Revives the service if an OEM kills it (Samsung, MIUI, Honor) |
| Repost-on-dismiss receiver | Restores the persistent notification within ~1 s if the user swipes it away |

## Mute notifications

The bell icon in the toolbar opens a bottom sheet listing every camera and Frigate `groups` defined in your config. Tap to silence; tap again to unmute. Mutes are persisted locally and respected by `FrigateAlertService` — muted streams drop reviews before they hit the notification channel, so DND-bypassing alerts stay silent too.

## Live stats

Both the top-bar badges and the full stats panel are fed by Frigate's `/api/stats` endpoint, polled every 2 seconds while the activity is visible. Parsing tolerates Frigate 0.13 / 0.14 / 0.15+ schema drift (`cpu_usages`, `gpu_usages` vs legacy `gpus`, percent-suffixed string values, nested `service.uptime`).

The stats panel surfaces:

- CPU and GPU cards with progress bars and 3-tier tint: muted (idle), amber at or above 50 %, red at or above 75 %.
- RAM chip, uptime chip.
- Per-detector inference time.
- Per-camera capture FPS and detection FPS.

If polling fails, the badges dim after 10 seconds instead of lying bright.

## Downloads

Video clips and snapshots from Frigate:

- Works on both internal (self-signed) and external networks.
- Configurable destination: `Downloads/Frigate` (default), Pictures, Movies, or Downloads root.
- Progress notifications with an **Open** action on completion.

## Deep linking

The app registers the `frigate://` scheme.

| URI | Opens |
|---|---|
| `frigate://home` | Camera grid |
| `frigate://settings` | Settings root |
| `frigate://review/<id>` | Specific review segment |
| `frigate://event/<id>` | Specific event in Explore view |
| `frigate://motion?camera=<name>&ts=<unixSeconds>` | Recording timeline at that moment |
| `frigate://camera/<id>` | Specific camera (planned) |

## Permissions

Minimum viable set. Nothing else is requested.

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` | Base connectivity |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Required to read SSID on Android 13–16 (callback `WifiInfo` is otherwise redacted to `<unknown ssid>`). Used only for auto-switching, never sent off-device |
| `RECORD_AUDIO`, `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` | Two-way talk to doorbell / intercom cameras |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Alerts and detections |
| `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` | Lets the alerts channel bypass Do Not Disturb (granted by you in System Settings, not on install) |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | Alert listener lifetime |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Re-start the listener after reboot |
| `WAKE_LOCK` | Finish handling an incoming alert before the CPU suspends again |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Optional, prompted once on notification enable |
| `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` | In-app updater from GitHub releases |

## Requirements

- Android 10 (API 29) minimum, Android 13+ recommended.
- Frigate NVR with local and / or remote access. Notifications require Frigate **0.13+** (the review system that emits the curated notification feed over `/ws`). Stats parsing supports 0.13 through 0.17.

## Privacy

- **Viewer only.** All processing happens on your Frigate server. No cloud relay, no analytics, no telemetry, no crash reporting.
- **Local storage only.** Session cookies and the `frigate_token` live in app-private storage. The Frigate account password is kept in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- **No ads.**
- **Open source.** Auditable end to end.

## Support

If Phylax made your life easier and you'd like to say thanks, a coffee goes a long way towards keeping the app maintained. No pressure. Bug reports and PRs are equally welcome.

## Traditional Chinese TV viewer (TV0.2)

This branch starts from `feature/zh-tw-i18n`, not the experimental TV remote patches.
The app uses a separate package (`com.asksakis.freegate.tw.tv.viewer`) and the repository's
fixed CI debug key. It can coexist with the earlier differently signed TV test app.

The viewer targets Frigate 0.18 desktop markup. The TV menu exposes groups, recordings,
and native Phylax settings. Server administration links are hidden only in this viewer.
Group streaming preferences are still edited and saved through Frigate's own forms.

Android consumes each remote key once and delegates web commands to one active scope.
Nested dialogs and Radix select menus retain their opener and restore focus on return.
Native settings, system dialogs, and the keyboard keep Android's native input handling.
No external JavaScript-to-Android bridge is exposed by the TV controller.

Run the browser regression fixture in `tests/tv` with `npm ci`, install Playwright's
Chromium browser, and run `node test.cjs`. It covers actual Radix nested dialogs/selects,
directional camera navigation, scrolling, and suppression of background Escape shortcuts.
This fixture does not replace physical TV/WebView or live camera playback testing.
